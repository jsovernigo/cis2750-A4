************
Limitations
************

	With the manipulation of the forward/backward arrows on a browser,
the passing of items between two pages can be desynchronized, and broken.
If you want to transition pages, change using the back button provided on
the page only, unless none is provided, in which case, the back arrow is 
safe to use.

	Also please note that he change author, and the add/remove author page
is available through the same button in the top left hand corner. This was
done to preserve the propogation of values between pages.
